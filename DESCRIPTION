Description: The GloveR package is a wrapper for the Global Vectors for Word Representation (http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) (GloVe). 'GloVe' is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.
